Today the Élysée Palace <a href="https://www.elysee.fr/emmanuel-macron/2022/02/20/entretien-telephonique-avec-vladimir-poutine-president-de-la-federation-de-russie-1" target="blank">announced</a> an immediate agreement between Presidents Macron and Putin to: 
* Negotiate a ceasefire 
* Achieve a diplomatic resolution to the Ukraine crisis
* "carry out all useful actions to avoid escalation, reduce risks and preserve peace."

The announcement indicated that these actions would begin today. 

## What was the source of Biden's warning?

"Some high-level European officials expressed frustration that the United States had not shared the intelligence that led it to surmise Russian's intentions with such certaintly," the <em>Washington Post</em> reported yesterday.

In that same article the <em>Washington Post</em> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/02/19/ukraine-russia-munich-zelensky/" target="blank">reported</a> that on the alleged source of Biden's Friday warning of an imminent invasion and attack on Kiev: 

"US intelligence that provided Biden with the confidence to make the assertion came from an order given to Russian subordinates to proceed with a full-scale attack, according to several people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the matter's sensitivity. The United States obtained intelligence on the order as Russian military and security officials were taking steps to implement it, and did so very recently, the people said.”

### CBS, NBC News echo Washington Post

Today NBC News and CBS News reported the same story reiterating that the intel was <em>very recently obtained</em>. 

* NBC News: "<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/us-intel-shows-russian-military-officials-order-proceed-invasion-ukrai-rcna17002" target="blank">U.S. intel shows Russian military officials given order to proceed with invasion of Ukraine.</a>"
* CBS News: "<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-invasion-us-intelligence-orders/" target="blank">US has intel that Russian commanders have orders to proceed with Ukraine invasion</a>."

### Special reconnaissance flights launched before Biden's press conference

As <a href="https://decodr.ai/blog/ukraine-invasion/" target="blank">we mentioned here</a>, the day before Biden's press conference, on February 17th, after approximately 2:00am Eastern Standard Time, the U.S. Air Force flew an RC-135U Combat Sent aircraft over the Black Sea near Crimea and Ukraine.

The Air Force has only two RC-135U Combat Sent planes: they provide intel directly to the President and SecDef.

Then on Thursday night (EST), a RC-135 Rivet Joint flew a mission over the Black Sea tracing the same route, but exploring further eastward.

Again last night, an RC-135 Rivet Joint flew another reconaissance mission over the same area. The L-shaped flight path was a similar to the earlier Rivet Joint flight.<br/>

Near real-time tracking of these planes was available on a <a href="https://globe.adsbexchange.com/?icao=ae0593" target="blank">public website</a>.

## World War 3 or a "psyop"?

Analyst J. Michael Waller had this to say on the intelligence leak that suggests Russia intends to take Kiev and all of Ukraine:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Why would any US intelligence official reveal our intercept capabilities? My guess is that the Russians made the transmission on near-open lines for PSYOP purposes, so that some genius at CIA would leak it to the WaPost and spread more fear and panic. <a href="https://t.co/m5yQyz7mg8">https://t.co/m5yQyz7mg8</a></p>&mdash; J Michael Waller (@JMichaelWaller) <a href="https://twitter.com/JMichaelWaller/status/1495456032755179521?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 20, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Waller allows that Russia may conduct limited military action against Ukraine; he sees Biden has having previously greenlit a "minor incursion."

Meanwhile the BBC reported UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson's view: "<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-60448162" target="blank">Russia plans biggest war in Europe since 1945.</a>"
