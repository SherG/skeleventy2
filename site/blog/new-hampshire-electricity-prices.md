Our local electricity provider Eversource has received an approval for a 112% increase in energy supply costs charged to consumers. This was first reported by media in June, which warned of "<a href="https://www.wmur.com/article/new-hampshire-increases-electricity-bills-61622/40314355" target="blank">drastic increases</a>" in bills.

Increased costs of natural gas were a main factor cited.

New England seems to suffer from poor (and short-sighted) energy design. (To be clear, this is not Eversource's fault.)

Some snapshots:

* We're adjacent to one of the most natural gas-rich regions (the Appalachian Basin) but for <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-22/new-england-power-plants-burn-most-oil-since-2011-as-gas-soars?sref=9Bl7eBfE" target="blank">lack of pipelines/capacity</a> we can't get adequate amounts delivered here.
* Because of the archaic Jones Act, we can't ship U.S.-produced LNG (liquified natural gas) from American ports to our <a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2013/04/f0/LNG%20Import%20&%20Export%20Terminal%20Maps%2012-18-2012.pdf" target="blank">terminals</a>.
* As a result we're dependent on importing LNG from foreign countries -- a process which burns more fossil fuels. And we <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-22/new-england-power-plants-burn-most-oil-since-2011-as-gas-soars" target="blank">burn "dirtier" oil</a> as winter temperatures plunge. 
* Boston Harbor's Everett Marine Terminal imported 60% of its LNG in 2020. Historically it's sourced LNG from Norway, Peru, Trinidad and Tobago, and Russia. (Massachussetts relies on natgas for two-thirds of its electricity needs.)
* Maine voters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/maine-voters-reject-quebec-hydropower-transmission-line-2021-11-03/" target="blank">scuttled</a> renewable energy plans for electricity transmission lines carrying <em>hydro</em> power into New England from Quebec. (A similar proposal was previously rejected by New Hampshire voters.)

Why the Jones Act has not already been <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-05-17/don-t-waive-the-jones-act-scrap-it" target="blank">nixed</a> is puzzling. Here's a passage from the <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/new-england-is-an-energy-crisis-waiting" target="blank">Doomberg Substack</a> that highlights the problems:

<div style="padding-left: 2.5em;"><p>A key stipulation of the law is that foreign-owned ships cannot transport goods between two US ports – only ships built, owned, and crewed by Americans are permitted to do so. While the US has become the largest producer of natural gas and an ever-larger exporter of LNG, the country does not produce LNG carriers. Since <strong>there are no US LNG carriers</strong>, <em>New England cannot benefit from the build-out of LNG export facilities along the Gulf of Mexico, despite having significant LNG import facilities like the one in Everett, Massachusetts</em>.</p></div> 

<div style="padding-left: 2.5em;"><p>That means<strong> New England is in the same bidding pool as Europe and Asia</strong>. Amazingly . . . Instead of simply building pipelines to its land neighbors, New England pays for boats to sail more than 2,000 miles – burning fossil fuels and polluting the oceans as they do so – and pays a substantially higher price for the privilege. Bonkers!</p></div> 

Being in the same bidding pool as Europe and Asia means we're <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-26/global-competition-for-lng-intensifies-on-new-russia-supply-cut" target="blank">subject to the LNG shortages and soaring prices <em>there</em></a>.

Time to stock up on firewood + seal those cracks.
